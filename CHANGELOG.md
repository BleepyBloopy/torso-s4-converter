## [v7.6] – 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Tab 0 — Sync** (always enabled, even before loading a drive): copies new and updated files from Mac source folders to USB without overwriting files already converted or renamed by this app.
  - `s4converter/sync.py` — `SyncTracker` class persists source-file identity (path + mtime + size) in `.s4_sync.json` at the project root. Tracker is source-centric: USB-side reorganisation is invisible to subsequent scans.
  - **Move detection** — if a source file disappears from one path and appears at another with the same filename + size, it is flagged `MOVED` instead of `DELETED`. Default action: duplicate the existing USB file (preserving any app conversions) to the new USB path, then prompt to delete the old copy.
  - `DELETED` findings start unchecked — nothing is removed from USB without explicit user confirmation.
  - **⚡ Sync + Convert** button: scans for new source files, copies them all to USB, then automatically switches to the Wav Format tab and starts its scan — the full first-session workflow in one click.
  - **Register Existing…** button: one-time setup for users who already have files on USB from a previous transfer. Scans both Mac source and USB, registers files already present on USB as synced (by stem match, handles format conversions). Files missing from USB appear as NEW on the next scan.
- Sync pairs configured in `config.json` under `sync_pairs` (label, source path, USB path per pair).
- Pair status labels in Sync tab show tracked file count and last sync date; hover shows full source → USB paths.
- `.s4_sync.json` added to `.gitignore` (contains machine-local absolute paths; 50 MB+ for large libraries).

## [v7.5] – 2026-06-06

### Changed
- **5 tabs instead of 4** — new order: 1. Wav Format → 2. Silence Remover → 3. Stereo to Mono → 4. BPM → 5. Name
  - "Format" renamed to "Wav Format"
  - "File Size" tab split into dedicated **Silence Remover** (phase 5) and **Stereo to Mono** (phase 4) tabs, each with their own columns and apply logic
  - "Names" renamed to "Name" and moved to last position
- **Name tab prefix UI** — "Override (optional)" column replaced with **"New prefix (opt.)"** with a clearer purpose: type a string to prepend to files *after* stripping the detected prefix (e.g. enter `Caribou140-` to produce `Caribou140-Kick.wav` from `SharedPrefix_Kick.wav`). "Detected Prefix" column remains editable for correcting the auto-detected value
- **Column auto-sizing** — table columns resize to content after every scan; last column always stretches to fill the full width; capped at 35% of viewport so long folder paths cannot push other columns off screen

### Fixed
- **Silence Remover always returned 0 findings** — `silencedetect` filter output is logged by ffmpeg at `AV_LOG_INFO` level, which was suppressed by `-v error`. Changed to `-v info`; all files with leading/trailing silence are now correctly detected
- **Silence scan skipped recently-renamed folders** — `apply_phase_2` was calling `FolderMarkers.mark_folder` after a prefix rename, blocking subsequent silence/stereo scans via the fast-scan folder marker. Now uses `FolderMarkers.invalidate` again so other tabs can rescan the folder
- **Replacement prefix re-detected on rescan** — after a Names apply that added a new prefix (e.g. `Caribou140-`), the next scan would detect that prefix as something to strip. Fixed by marking each renamed file as phase-2-done in the cache (`cache.mark_phase_done(new_path, 2)`); `scan_phase_2` filters these files out so the new prefix is never re-reported
- **0-findings scan collapsed column headers** — `resizeColumnToContents` with no rows shrinks all columns to header-text width. Now only called when there are rows to measure against

---

## [v7.4] – 2026-06-06

### Changed
- **Names tab — Prefix rows now show two columns**: "Detected Prefix" (read-only, what the scan found) and "Override (optional)" (editable, empty by default). Leaving Override empty strips the full detected prefix. Typing a custom value (e.g. `Caribou140bpm`) re-reads the folder live and strips that prefix instead — no stale-path mismatches.
- `apply_phase_2` now re-reads the folder live when a custom override prefix is provided, instead of relying on the `affected_files` list captured at scan time

### Fixed
- `apply_phase_2` failure when the Override column was edited to a value that didn't match the original `affected_files` paths; added per-file skip logging to surface the reason in the log pane

---

## [v7.3] – 2026-06-05

### Changed
- **No auto-rescan after Apply** — the automatic re-scan that triggered after every Apply is removed; rescan manually when needed
- **Per-file "done" flags in cache** — after Apply converts a file, a `done|phase|path|mtime|size` flag is written to the cache. On the next scan, files with a valid done flag are skipped entirely (no ffprobe). Files that were already correct format during a scan also get flagged. This makes re-scans O(new files) instead of O(total files) for the workflow of repeatedly adding samples to an existing library.

---

## [v7.2] – 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **OOM crash during scan** — `QTextEdit` undo stack no longer accumulates one entry per file scanned (disabled via `setUndoRedoEnabled(False)`); folder tree now only re-renders on folder transitions, not every file; current filename moved to a cheap `QLabel`
- **OOM crash at scan completion** — `QTableWidget` population now uses `setUpdatesEnabled(False)` to suppress repaint cascades; display capped at 5 000 rows (all findings still included in Apply)
- **UTF-8 crash on filenames with special characters** — all `subprocess.run` calls in `core.py` and cache load/save in `cache.py` now use `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"` so filenames containing `©`, `é`, etc. no longer crash ffprobe, ffmpeg, or cache I/O

### Added
- **Apply progress feedback** — progress bar now shows an accurate `X / Y files` count label and a `⟳ filename` line while Apply is running, matching the scan feedback style
- **⏹ Stop button during Apply** — same stop button used during scanning now also appears during Apply; stops cleanly after the current file completes, saves the cache, and logs how many files succeeded/failed

---

## [v7.1] – 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Live scan progress panel** — visible during any scan; shows completed folders (✓ green), active folder (▶ white, full path), current file being scanned (⟳), and a dimmed Pending section for folders not yet started. Covers all 6 phases.
- **⏹ Stop button** — appears during scanning; gracefully stops after the current batch, saves the cache, and re-enables the UI without requiring the app to close
- **`setup.sh`** — first-time setup script for macOS/Linux; installs ffmpeg + uv via Homebrew, creates venv, installs Python deps with aubio CFLAGS workaround
- **`launch-s4converter-MacOS.command`** — double-click launcher for macOS; runs `setup.sh` automatically on first launch
- **`launch-s4converter-Windows.bat`** — double-click launcher for Windows; checks for ffmpeg/uv then sets up venv
- **`core.open_folder()`** — cross-platform file manager opener replacing macOS-only `open` subprocess calls (`xdg-open` on Linux, `explorer` on Windows)
- **Global busy lock** — all scan/apply buttons across all tabs are disabled while any operation is running; re-enabled with correct state on completion
- **Quit guard** — warns before closing if a scan or apply is in progress; explains files are safe but a `.__tmp__.wav` may remain
- **`scan_phase_2_all()`** — Phase 2 now auto-scans all subfolders like every other phase instead of requiring manual folder-by-folder selection via folder picker
- **`config.json` dual paths** — `s4_root` + `usb_root` replace the single `base_dir`; GUI drive dropdown presets are now sourced from config values
- **Memory safeguards for large drives** — `parallel_ffprobe` processes files in configurable chunks (default 500); Phases 4 and 5 skip files above `analysis_max_size_mb` (default 200 MB) to prevent OOM when scanning USB root directories
- **CLAUDE.md** — codebase documentation for Claude Code

### Changed
- GUI consolidated from 6 tabs to 4: Prefixes + Long Names → **Names** tab; Stereo→Mono + Silence → **File Size** tab. Internal phase numbers (1–6) unchanged in core logic.
- `parallel_ffprobe` saves the probe cache to disk after every chunk (default every 500 files) — crash-safe resume: restarting re-scans using cache hits so at most one chunk is re-probed
- GUI prevents Mac idle sleep via `caffeinate -i` during any scan or apply (macOS only); terminated cleanly on completion or app close. Note: `caffeinate` prevents idle sleep but does not prevent display loss when switching monitor inputs on a shared monitor setup — use the CLI for unattended scans in that scenario, or use a headless dummy plug
- Phase 6 (BPM detection): high-confidence results (≥ 0.75) are now **checked by default** following S-4 OS v2.2 confirmation that BPM-in-filename is required for proper DISC sync-mode loading
- `PARALLEL_FFPROBE_WORKERS` reduced from 4 → 2 (configurable via `ffprobe_workers` in `config.json`)
- Phase 2 tab label and help text updated to reflect auto-scan behaviour

### Fixed
- Drive dropdown presets were hardcoded; now read from `config.USB_ROOT` and `config.S4_ROOT`
- Phase 6 BPM skip logic: folder hints now only skip when the folder name does **not** contain "loop" — e.g. "Kick Drums" is skipped but "Kick Loops" is detected. Expanded hints to include common drum hit terms: kick, snare, hat, hihat, cymbal, clap, tom, ride, crash, rimshot, 808, perc, shaker, tamb, conga, bongo
- Drive dropdown now snaps to "Custom…" when a manually typed path doesn't match any preset
- Cache always lives at the configured drive root (`usb_root` or `s4_root`) via `config.cache_root_for()` — scanning any subfolder (e.g. `Download Samples/drums/`) reuses the same probe data as a full-library scan; status bar and log show the cache file path

## [v7.0] – 2026-05-27

Complete rewrite of the original single-file script into a structured Python package.

### Added
- `s4converter/` package with separated modules: `core`, `cache`, `cli`, `gui`, `config`
- **Persistent ffprobe cache** (`ProbeCache`) — skips unchanged files on re-scans (~150× faster)
- **Per-folder markers** (`FolderMarkers`) — skips entire folders that haven't changed
- **Parallel ffprobe workers** — probes multiple files simultaneously on first scan
- **PyQt6 GUI** — tab-per-phase interface with background worker threads, inline editing, progress bars
- **CLI** with `--dry-run`, `--quick`, `--phases`, `--full-scan` flags
- **Phase 6: Stereo → Mono detection** — classifies files as `dual_mono`, `one_side`, `near_mono`, or `true_stereo` using peak dB math; saves ~50 % per converted file
- Drive preset dropdown in GUI (USB / S-4 Root / Custom)
- Per-phase help panels with thresholds and workflow tips
- `config.json` at repo root for user-editable settings (no Python required)
- `requirements.txt`

### Changed
- `NAME_LENGTH_LIMIT` raised from 50 → 70 characters
- Config split: `config.json` (user edits) + `config.py` (loader + internal constants)

---

## [v6.0] – 2025-12-31

Original single-file script (`smart_converter_v6.py`).

### Added
- 5 interactive CLI phases run sequentially with user prompts
- **Phase 1** – Non-WAV conversion (MP3, AIFF, FLAC → 48 kHz WAV; auto bit depth)
- **Phase 2** – Sample rate compliance (resample to 48 kHz, preserve bit depth)
- **Phase 3** – Bit depth optimisation (24-bit files > 10 s → 16-bit)
- **Phase 4** – Shared prefix removal (folder-targeted, auto-detect + manual fallback)
- **Phase 5** – Long filename cleanup (stems > 50 chars, suggest + manual rename)
- Smart history: remembers last run time, offers incremental scan on launch
- `NAME_LENGTH_LIMIT = 50`
